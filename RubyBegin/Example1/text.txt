Corporations have the need to raise capital for a number of reasons. Smaller firms need capital to start up operations. 
Larger firms need capital to expand operations and to finance inventory. 
There are various ways in which a firm can raise capital through the financial system and numerous individuals and entities that can assist a corporation in this crucial venture.

Start-up firms and small businesses petition investors for what is known as venture capital. 
Venture capital comes from wealthy investors, usually a group, who see the potential for growth in smaller businesses. 
In the early 1990â€™s the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expanded its role to assist small businesses. 
The SEC made it easier for small businesses to raise capital through public stock offerings.
